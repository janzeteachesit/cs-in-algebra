Unit 1 - Course A
> The first 10 hour course provides students with the foundational skills and knowledge to begin using computer programming as a tool to learn about and develop algebraic functions. Students will be introduced to a graphical programming language designed for Algebra instruction, through which they will gain a deeper understanding of the order of operations, create images with algebraic expressions, and learn a technique for creating functions called the Design Recipe.
> By the end of Course A students will have the tools necessary to turn word problems from their own Algebra class into functions that can be used as mini apps.
